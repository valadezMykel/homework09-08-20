### Project Goals

The purpose of this project was to refactor the html of an existing webpage to increase symantic value.  Increasing the symantic value of the webpage will make it more accesible to users, especially userers with disabilities.  To do this html tags must be replaced for ones that provide semantic meaning such as including a main, section, or artilce tag when applicable. 

------

### Project outcome

Successfully created semantic meaning by applying approprate html tags.  Also cleaned up the css page by appyling the DRY rule.
